## hw1
In this hw, we do some exploratory data analysis.

### Part 1 – State College weather station data
We show the importance of removing missing and trace data from calculations of summary statistics and schematic plots 
(fancy box plots).

### Part 2 – NAO and AMO
We investigate the NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) 
and AMO (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) through:

* summary statistics
* histograms and kernel density estimates (KDEs) at various bin- and band-widths.
