## hw5
In this hw, we create self-organizing maps using (SOM Toolbox)[http://www.cis.hut.fi/somtoolbox/] 
in Matlab on the same fake data as in [hw4](../hw4).
The training is done using [SOM_PAK](http://www.cis.hut.fi/research/som_lvq_pak.shtml) via the Matlab interface 
built in to SOM Toolbox. 

Probably won't make a Notebook.
